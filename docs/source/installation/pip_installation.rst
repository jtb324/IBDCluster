Installing DRIVE from Pip
=========================

DRIVE v2.0.0 has been officially released on `PYPI <https://pypi.org/project/drive-ibd/>`_! This installation method is recommended for those who wish to use the software without any internal modification. PIP will install all of the necessary dependencies of DRIVE so that the user doesn't have to worry about dependency management. 

.. note::

    The recommend way to install DRIVE using pip would be to either create a virtual environment using `Anaconda <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_ or `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_. Once you activate the virtual environment then you can use the above pip command to install DRIVE into an isolated environment.


DRIVE can be installed using the following command:

.. code::

    pip install drive-ibd


If the install is successful, then you can run the following command and you should see a help message:

.. code::

    drive --help
